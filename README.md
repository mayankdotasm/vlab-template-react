# Finite Automata

### 
Finite Automata DFA and NFA Virtual Lab - Interactive virtual lab for exploring and experimenting with DFAs and NFAs. This repository includes tools, resources, and simulation scripts to help you understand how to construct, visualize, and work with Deterministic and Non-deterministic Finite Automata.

## üõ† Features

- **Interactive Simulation**: Explore and simulate both DFA and NFA machines through a dynamic interface.
- **DFA Simulation**: Experiment with deterministic automata and visualize the state transitions based on input symbols.
- **NFA Simulation**: Understand the non-deterministic behavior of NFAs, allowing for multiple possible state transitions for a single input symbol.
- **Transition Diagrams**: Visualize how different inputs and states interact in both types of finite automata.

## üí° Why Finite Automata?

This project aims to enhance understanding of finite automata, which are fundamental concepts in formal languages, automata theory, and computation. By providing an interactive platform, users can experiment with both deterministic and non-deterministic automata to grasp their construction, behavior, and real-world applications in areas like language recognition and computational theory.

## üöÄ How to Use

1. **Choose Your Automaton Type**: Select either **DFA** or **NFA** to start building your automaton.
2. **Define States and Transitions**: Add states and define transition rules to create your automaton.
3. **Test with Input**: Provide input strings to see how your automaton processes them and check if they are accepted or rejected.
4. **Visualize Transitions**: Watch the state transitions in real-time with the visual diagram updates.
